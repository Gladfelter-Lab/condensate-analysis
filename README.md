To analyze images of condensates, we built a custom Python code that included scikit-image, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and scipy (Harris et al., 2020; McKinney, 2011; Pedregosa et al., 2011; Virtanen et al., 2020; Walt et al., 2014). In brief, the code identifies the protein and RNA channel and separates the two. Using the protein channel, a mask was made using Otsu thresholding and water shedding to identify separate objects. The shape, centroid, integrated intensity of the entire object, and the average intensity of pixels including and immediately adjacent to the centroid were measured in both channels. Objects with a volume less than 125 pixels and an average protein centroid intensity less than 1000 were excluded as noise. These parameters can be adjusted accordingly.
